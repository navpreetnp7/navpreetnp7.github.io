            My work focused on training and implementing a Language Model for the Intelligent Search application for our client Baker Hughes. I implemented pdf parsing on the technical pdf documents as well as the BERT Transformer language model using sentence similarity for intelligent search.

          Detection of tumors using Lung Nodule Analysis in CT Scans
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I trained an end-to-end complex deep neural network using Pytorch based on Lung Nodule Analysis dataset of chest CT scans, finding the nodules using simple CNN residual network architecture and then identifying the tumours using state of the art U-Net Architecture for Object Detection and Image segmentation and then using transfer learning to use the same resnet model to train and classify them as benign/malignant.

          I cleaned and prepared UCI DNA sequences data. Used exploratory data analysis to do feature engineering and trained the dataset on KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest and Adaboost classifiers using pandas and sklearn to select the best performing model which was SVM.

          Predicting house prices using Liner Regression trained on Ames Housing Dataset
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I cleaned, prepared, and visualised Ames Housing dataset and performed feature selection and feature engineering using pandas, seaborn and scipy. Then trained the data on Linear Regression techniques lasso and gradient boosting using sklearn and used ensemble method stacking and averaging the models to produce the best fit for the data.
