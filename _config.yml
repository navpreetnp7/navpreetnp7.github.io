          Fake image generator conditioned on facial attributes
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Implemented and trained Conditional DCGAN as a part of NYU Computer Vision Course project, using the celebrity dataset with facial attributes and base deep convolutional GAN architecture with Minimax loss function. Conditioned the generator on facial attributes like hair in order to produce fake images containing such attributes.

          Detection of tumors using Lung Nodule Analysis in CT Scans
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I trained an end-to-end complex deep neural network using Pytorch based on Lung Nodule Analysis dataset of chest CT scans, finding the nodules using simple CNN residual network architecture and then identifying the tumours using state of the art U-Net Architecture for Object Detection and Image segmentation and then using transfer learning to use the same resnet model to train and classify them as benign/malignant.

          Predicting house prices using Liner Regression trained on Ames Housing Dataset
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I cleaned, prepared, and visualised Ames Housing dataset and performed feature selection and feature engineering using pandas, seaborn and scipy. Then trained the data on Linear Regression techniques lasso and gradient boosting using sklearn and used ensemble method stacking and averaging the models to produce the best fit for the data.
